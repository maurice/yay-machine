[![a Starlight app](https://astro.badg.es/v2/built-with-starlight/tiny.svg)](https://starlight.astro.build)

It's [a Starlight app](https://starlight.astro.build) that is ultimately builds to static assets, then deployed to GitHub pages, and hosted at https://yay-machine.js.org/.

## Project Structure

Starlight looks for `.md` or `.mdx` files in the `src/content/docs/` directory. Each file is exposed as a route based on its file name. Sidebar config is in `astro.config.mjs`, but page titles/order is generally defined in the page's front matter.

Images can be added to `src/assets/` and embedded in Markdown with a relative link.

Static assets, like favicons, can be placed in the `public/` directory.

We have some custom CSS styles in `src/styles/custom.css`.

Custom components (increasingly mostly React) are in `src/components`.

## Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:
