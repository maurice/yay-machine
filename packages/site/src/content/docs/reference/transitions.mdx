Transitions bring state-machines to life, defining when and how they move from state-to-state.

## Example: connection machine

We will expand on the "connection machine" example we used when explaining [states](/reference/state/) and [events](/reference/events/), to illustrate various transitions.

      to: "connecting",
      label: "(after delay)\nCONNECT",
    },
    {
      from: "reattemptConnection",
      to: "connectionError",

### Usage

<Code code={connectionMachineUsage} lang="typescript" />

## Specific State, On Event

The simplest and most obvious types of transition are done in a specific state, because of a specific event.

In the above machine we see this for

<StateChart
  states={["disconnected", "connecting"]}
  transitions={[{ from: "disconnected", to: "connecting", label: "CONNECT" }]}
  direction="LR"
  compact={true}
/>

and

<StateChart
  states={["connecting", "connected"]}
  transitions={[{ from: "connecting", to: "connected", label: "CONNECTED" }]}
  direction="LR"
  compact={true}
/>

and

<StateChart
  states={["connected", "reattemptConnection"]}
  transitions={[
    { from: "connected", to: "reattemptConnection", label: "ERROR" },
  ]}
  direction="LR"
  compact={true}
/>

(And elsewhere.)

These types of transitions are defined at `states[stateName].on[EVENT_NAME]` in the definition config

```typescript "states" "[stateName]" /\s(on)/ "[EVENT_NAME]"
const machine = defineMachine<State, Event>({
  states: {
    [stateName]: {
      on: {
        [EVENT_NAME]: {
          to: "nextStateName",
          /* ... other options ... */
        },
        // ...
      },
    },
    // ...
  },
});
```

### `reenter: false`

In some cases we want to handle an event in a specific state, and _remain in the same state_, without exiting and re-entering the state.

In the above machine we see this happens for

<StateChart
  states={["connected"]}
  transitions={[{ from: "connected", to: "connected", label: "SEND" }]}
  direction="LR"
  compact={true}
/>

This can be used to perform a **transition side-effect** and still keep any current **state entry side-effect** active (ie, not call their cleanup function, and allow them to continue to `send` events to the machine).

Simply add `reenter: false` to the transition

```typescript "to: stateName" "reenter: false"
const machine = defineMachine<State, Event>({
  states: {
    [stateName]: {
      on: {
        [EVENT_NAME]: {
          to: stateName, // remain in current state
          reenter: false,
          onTransition: ({ state, event }) => ({
            /* ... */
          }), // optional side-effect
        },
        // ...
      },
    },
    // ...
  },
});
```

## Any State, On Event

In some cases it's more convenient to handle an event in _any state_.

In the above machine we see this for

<StateChart
  states={["<<any state>>", "disconnected"]}
  transitions={[
    { from: "<<any state>>", to: "disconnected", label: "DISCONNECT" },
  ]}
  direction="LR"
  compact={true}
/>

These types of transitions are defined at `on[EVENT_NAME]` in the definition config

```typescript /\s(on)/ "[EVENT_NAME]"
const machine = defineMachine<State, Event>({
  // ...
  on: {
    [EVENT_NAME]: {
      to: "nextStateName",
      /* ... other options ... */
    },
  },
});
```

### Optional `to`

Sometimes we want to handle an event in _any state_ and then **return to the current state**.

In the above machine we see this for the `HEARTBEAT` event

<StateChart
  states={["<<current state>>"]}
  transitions={[
    { from: "<<current state>>", to: "<<current state>>", label: "HEARTBEAT" },
  ]}
  direction="LR"
  compact={true}
/>

This technique is typically used to update state-data. For example, the connection machine updates the `lastHeartbeatTime` state-data property whenever it receives a `HEARTBEAT` event.

```typescript {4-6}
const machine = defineMachine<State, Event>({
  // ...
  on {
    [EVENT_NAME]: {
      data: ({ state, event }) => ({ ...state, /* ... */ }),
    },
  },
});
```

## Conditional transitions: `when()`

Wherever you can define a transition, you can also define _an array of transitions_, where some or all have a `when()` callback.

In the above machine we see this happens for

<StateChart
  states={["connecting", "reattemptConnection", "connectionError"]}
  transitions={[
    {
      from: "connecting",
      to: "connectionError",
      label: "ERROR (invalid auth)",
    },
    { from: "connecting", to: "reattemptConnection", label: "ERROR (default)" },
  ]}
  compact={true}
/>

The `when()` callback has a single parameter with fields for the current `state` and the `event`, and SHOULD be pure and deterministic, ie, only using `state` and `event` to decide which transition to take.

Conditional transitions are evaluated in their definition order:

- the machine takes the first transition where `when()` returns `true`, or there is no `when()`
- no transition is taken if all transition `when()`s return `false`, and there is no "default" transition

```typescript "when: ({ state, event }) => { /* ... */ }"
const machine = defineMachine<State, Event>({
  states: {
    [stateName]: {
      on: {
        [EVENT_NAME]: [
          { to: 'firstState', when: ({ state, event }) => { /* ... */ }, /* ... other options */ },
          { to: 'firstState', when: ({ state, event }) => { /* ... */ }, /* ... other options */ },
          { to: 'secondState', when: ({ state, event }) => { /* ... */ }, /* ... other options */ },
          { to: 'thirdState', /* "default" transition ... other options */ },
        ]
      }
    }
    // ...
  },
  on {
    [OTHER_EVENT_NAME]: [
      // array of potential transitions
    ],
  },
});
```

## Immediate transitions: `always`

Immediate transitions (often combined with conditional transitions) are taken immediately, on entering a state.

In the above machine we see this happens for

<StateChart
  states={["reattemptConnection", "connectionError"]}
  transitions={[
    {
      from: "reattemptConnection",
      to: "connectionError",
      label: "(reached max connection attempts)",
    },
  ]}
  compact={true}
/>

Immediate transitions belong to a state node in the definition config at `states[stateName].always`

```typescript "states" "[stateName]" "always"
const machine = defineMachine<State, Event>({
  states: {
    [stateName]: {
      always: {
        /* a single transition */
      },
      // OR
      always: [
        /* multiple potential transitions using `when()` */
      ],
    },
  },
  // ...
});
```

Immediate transitions are also sometimes called "event less" since they are not triggered due to any specific event, but instead by simply entering a state. For this reason the `event` property of the `when()` and `data()` callback argument will be `undefined` for these transitions.

## Generate state data: `data()`

Since states can have associated data, you often need to provide a `data()` callback in the transition to generate the data for the next state.

This callback MUST only ever generate a new object. NEVER mutate the current state data.

The callback receives the current `state` and `event`.

The callback SHOULD be pure and deterministic, and only use data from `state` and `event` to compute the data for the next state.

For _homogenous_ state-data you also have the option to set `enableCopyDataOnTransition: true` to avoid some boilerplate. See the [states](/reference/state/) documentation for a longer discussion.

## Combining transitions

We can mix-and-match most of the above, eg:

- anywhere you can define a transition, it can be a single transition or multiple potential transitions
- anywhere you can define a transition, you can use `when()`, `data()` and `onTransition()`
- event-driven transitions from specific states MAY co-exist with immediate `always` transitions (the `reattemptConnection` state in the example above does this)

The two _special cases_ in the configuration are

- `to` is optional in an _any state_ transitions: if `to` is not provided, it means exit and re-enter the current state, updating data if relevant
- `reenter: false` in a state + event transition means perform the optional side-effect but do not exit and re-enter the current state or update data

## Side-effects: `onTransition()`

Transitions MAY define an [`onTransition()` side-effect](/reference/side-effects#transition-ontransition) function that is called if and when the transition is taken.

In the above state machine there are transition side effects when handling

- the `SEND` event in the `connected` state
- the `CONNECT` event in the `reattemptConnection` state

The `onTransition()` function receives a single parameter with fields for the current `state`, `event`, and a `send` function which can be used to send events back to the machine instance. It MAY return a cleanup function to release any associated resources, and if so that is called immediately after `onTransition()` is called.
