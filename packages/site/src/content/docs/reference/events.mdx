Events represent the things that affect the [state of the machine](/reference/state/) as it runs.

## Events are finite

Just like states, we know all the events when the machine is defined.

import StateChart from "../../../components/StateChart/StateChart.astro";

<StateChart
  states={["disconnected", "connecting", "connected", "connectionError"]}
  transitions={[
    { from: "disconnected", to: "connecting", label: "CONNECT" },
    { from: "connecting", to: "connected", label: "CONNECTED" },
    { from: "connecting", to: "connectionError", label: "ERROR" },
    { from: "connected", to: "disconnected", label: "DISCONNECTED" },
  ]}
  start="disconnected"
  end="connectionError"
  compact={true}
/>

In this "connection" state-machine, the events are `CONNECT`, `CONNECTED`, `DISCONNECTED` and `ERROR`.

Finite means the machine will only respond to these events; the machine would ignore any other events.

## The Event type

**yay-machine** events follow the standard shape, with a `type: string` and optional "payload" (ie, any other properties you need).

```typescript
type ConnectionEvent =
  | ConnectEvent
  | ConnectedEvent
  | ErrorEvent
  | DisconnectedEvent;

interface ConnectEvent {
  readonly type: "CONNECT";
  readonly url: string;
}

interface ConnectedEvent {
  readonly type: "CONNECTED";
}

interface DisconnectedEvent {
  readonly type: "DISCONNECTED";
}

interface ErrorEvent {
  readonly type: "ERROR";
  readonly error: Error;
}
```

## Sending an event to a machine

To send an event to a machine, you'll need a running instance, then simply call it's `send()` method:

```typescript {4}
const connectionMachine = defineMachine<ConnectionState, ConnectionEvent>({
  /* ... */
});

const connection = connectionMachine.newInstance().start();
connection.send({ type: "CONNECT", url: "ws://localhost:9999/api" });
```

Of course the machine is type-safe, so you'll get an error trying to send anything else

```typescript "type: 'HELLO'"
// ❌ ts(2322): Type '"HELLO"' is not assignable to type '"CONNECT" | "CONNECTED"' | "DISCONNECTED"' | "ERROR"'.
connection.send({ type: "HELLO" });
```

## Event payload

When your events have a payload (any other properties apart from `type`), you can use these to

- generate state data for the next state [in a transition](/reference/transitions/)
- determine which [conditional transition](/reference/transitions/#conditional-transitions-when) to take

```typescript "data: ({ event: { url } }) => ({ url })" "data: ({ event }) => ({ errorMessage: String(event.error) })" "url: 'ws://localhost:9999/api'"
type ConnectionState =
  | { readonly name: "disconnected" }
  | { readonly name: "connecting" | "connected"; readonly url: string }
  | { readonly name: "connectionError"; readonly errorMessage: string };

const connectionMachine = defineMachine<ConnectionState, ConnectionEvent>({
  initialState: { name: "disconnected", url: "<none>" },
  states: {
    disconnected: {
      on: {
        CONNECT: {
          to: "connecting",
          data: ({ event: { url } }) => ({ url }),
        },
      },
    },
    connecting: {
      on: {
        ERROR: {
          to: "connectionError",
          data: ({ event }) => ({ errorMessage: String(event.error) }),
        },
      },
    },
    // ...
  },
});

const connection = connectionMachine.newInstance().start();

connection.subscribe(({ state }) => {
  if (state.name === "connecting") {
    console.log("connecting to", state.url);
  }
  if (state.name === "connectionError") {
    console.log("connectionFailed: %s", state.errorMessage);
  }
});

connection.send({ type: "CONNECT", url: "ws://localhost:9999/api" });
```

## Subscribers receive last event

When you subscribe for state changes, you _might also_ get the event which triggered the state change.

```typescript "event"
const connection = connectionMachine.newInstance().start();
connection.subscribe(({ state, event }) => {
  console.log(
    "now in state %s, triggered by",
    state.name,
    event /* ConnectionEvent | undefined */,
  );
});
```

When an event triggers a state-transition, `event` will be that event.

Sometimes `event` will be `undefined`:

- the first time the subscriber callback is called: it only receives the machine's current state
- when the machine transitions to a new state due to an immediate (always) transition; this is an "eventless" transition
