State machines have some very desirable properties

- they can model a variety of domains including business-logic, workflows, physical objects, UI or game components, and app state
- they make the **‚Äúcurrent state‚Äù a first class concept**, rather than some derived value, and that is almost always useful
- they are **declarative** (not imperative): you define the "rules" at compile-time, while the library provides the run-time
- state-machine definitions are usually **concise**; it is often possible to describe quite complex workflows in one typical-length source file, and therefore comprehend the whole workflow in one place, rather than referring to multiple sources. In this way they have _great signal to noise ratio_
- relatively few concepts; as with all things there is a learning curve, but it's a **simple mental model**
- they are **deterministic**: predictable and reliable
- they are **safe**: we can ensure specific events are only handled in specific states and avoid those ‚Äúthis should never happen‚Äù bugs altogether
- building a UI for a state-machine tends to result in simple, clean code, and since they are view-agnostic, the same machine could have an arbitrary number of different UIs
- they are typically straightforward to unit test

## Example

Here's an example state machine diagram for a "buy tickets" user-journey.

import { Aside } from "@astrojs/starlight/components";
import { StateChart } from "../../../components";

<Aside type="tip" title="It's alive">
  This state machine diagram is interactive - try hovering and clicking around.
</Aside>

<StateChart
  states={[
    "selectTickets",
    "validateTickets",
    "basket",
    "applyingVoucher",
    "yourDetails",
    "payment",
    "processingPayment",
    "confirmation",
  ]}
  transitions={[
    { from: "selectTickets", to: "validateTickets", label: "ADD_TO_BASKET" },
    { from: "selectTickets", to: "basket", label: "VIEW_BASKET" },
    {
      from: "validateTickets",
      to: "selectTickets",
      label: "¬´immediate¬ª\n(invalid selection)",
    },
    {
      from: "validateTickets",
      to: "basket",
      label: "¬´immediate¬ª\n(valid selection)",
    },
    { from: "basket", to: "selectTickets", label: "CONTINUE_SHOPPING" },
    { from: "basket", to: "applyingVoucher", label: "APPLY_VOUCHER" },
    { from: "applyingVoucher", to: "basket" },
    { from: "basket", to: "yourDetails", label: "CHECKOUT" },
    { from: "yourDetails", to: "payment", label: "PAY_NOW" },
    { from: "payment", to: "processingPayment", label: "COMPLETE_PURCHASE" },
    { from: "processingPayment", to: "confirmation", label: "PAYMENT_SUCCESS" },
    { from: "processingPayment", to: "payment", label: "PAYMENT_FAILURE" },
  ]}
  start="selectTickets"
  initial="selectTickets"
  end="confirmation"
  compact={true}
  interactive={true}
/>

Next we're going to cover the basics of state-machines.

## State

State-machine definitions model all the possible states in which the machine can exist.

In the above example the state-names are `selectTickets`, `validateTickets` (a transient decision-state rendered as a diamond), `basket`, `applyingVoucher`, `yourDetails`, `payment`, `paymentProcessing` and `confirmation`.

State-machine states are finite and known at the time the machine is defined (usually compile-time).

In this example we could easily use the machine's current-state name with a UI router, to determine the correct page to render.

A good state machine library will support _dynamic "associated data" for each state_ (see below). In the above example we would want the state-machine to store the various form entries (selected tickets, user-details, etc) to complete the purchase, or show error messages.

## Events

State-machines are event-driven and require events to move between states.

In the above example the event-types are `ADD_TO_BASKET`, `CONTINUE_SHOPPING`, `APPLY_VOUCHER`, `CHECKOUT`, `PAY_NOW`, `COMPLETE_PURCHASE`, `PAYMENT_SUCCESS` and `PAYMENT_FAILURE`.

Events are also finite and known at compile-time.

Events are very flexible and can be used to represent

- A user mouse click
- API request from client
- Async database query result
- Response from remote service
- Internal timer generated by the state-machine's own side-effect
- Etc

A good state-machine library should support _dynamic payloads for each event_, and expose this for conditional transitions and to update associated state-data.

## Transitions

When the state-machine moves from one state to another, we call this a transition.

Good state-machine libraries will support a variety of transitions, including

- by sending an event to the machine in a certain state, if the machine has a matching transition for that state and event. In the above example the machine transitions from `yourDetails` to `payment` when sent the `PAY_NOW` event
- by sending an event to the machine in _any state_, if the machine does have a matching transition for the current state, but has a generic transition that works in _any state_. You can therefore model your machine with transitions that only handle specific events in specific states, and/or handle specific events in _any state_.
- "immediate" transitions, which are evaluated on entering a state. In the above example the `applyingVoucher` state immediately transitions back the the `basket` state
- conditional transitions, where predicate functions determine which one of a number of potential transitions (if any) is taken. In the above example the `selectTickets` state either transitions to `basket` or back to `selectTickets` if the selection is invalid
- transition side-effects, which perform some I/O with the outside world when taking a specific transition

Usually transitions/features can be combined, eg, immediate + conditional, _any state_ + side-effect, etc.

## State-data

Now you know about states, events and transitions, let's revisit "state-data"...

If states are finite where does all the other data go? Eg in the example above we would want to capture the selected tickets, user details, payment details, etc.

This is where state-data comes in; it allows us to store arbitrary data in the machine instance state, eg

- User settings
- Shopping basket items
- Other state machines
- etc

We could store these externally but there are several advantages to keeping it in the state machine

- Transition condition predicates can query the current state's data (and the event if any) to determine whether the transition should be taken
- Transitions update state (name + data) atomically, so the machine's current state (name + data) is always valid and type-safe

## Interacting with the outside world

States, events and transitions give us a lot already.

But it isn't enough to build complex real-world systems. At some point we need to interact with a web API, or query the database, or do some logging.

A good state-machine library will allow you to express these interactions within the machine definition, and actually perform those interactions (run the code) when operating machine instances.

## Putting it all together

State-machines are a one-stop-shop for state-management.

They work well with popular modern paradigms like _immutable data_ and _functional-reactive programming_.

They include everything you need to model a variety of domains.

A good TypeScript state-machine library will also give you great type-safety üòâ.
