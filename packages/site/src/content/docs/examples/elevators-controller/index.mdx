## About

This example models a controller for a group of co-located [elevators](/examples/elevator/).

For example, a large office or apartment building might place 3 elevators together. The controller represents the buttons in the lobby that passengers use to initially request an elevator.

This machine's state data includes _the elevator machine instances_, so it has easy access to them when dispatching them to various floors, and tracking their progress.

In this machine's `onStart()` side-effect it subscribes to the elevators's states and if any reach a `doorsOpen` state and were requested by the controller, sends a `ELEVATOR_ARRIVED` event to the controller machine instance, which removes the floor-request from the pending queue.

When a passenger requests an elevator it checks the existing pending requests and if one already exists for that floor, ignores it (ie, it doesn't add a duplicate request).

When there are no existing requests for that floor, it ranks the elevators using a few simple rules to find the best one. It then creates an "internal" `REQUESTING_ELEVATOR` event whose payload carries the selected elevator, and _sends this event to itself_ in the `onTransition()` side-effect, during the transition to the temporary `requesting` state.

The `requesting` state receives the `REQUESTING_ELEVATOR` event, and sends a `VISIT_FLOOR` event to the selected elevator. Then we return to the `busy` state (and potentially immediately to `idle` via a conditional immediate transition from `busy`) once more and wait for more requests.

The `REQUESTING_ELEVATOR` event shows how we can share ephemeral data between states without having to add it (temporarily) to the machine's state-data.
