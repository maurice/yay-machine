/**

## Usage

```typescript
const guess = guessMachine.newInstance().start();

while (guess.state.name === "playing") {
  guess.send({ type: "GUESS", guess: Math.ceil(Math.random() * 10) });
}

if (guess.state.name === "guessedCorrectly") {
  console.log("yay, we won :)");
} else if (guess.state.name === "tooManyIncorrectGuesses") {
  console.log("boo, we lost :(");
} else {
  assert.fail(`Invalid state: ${guess.state.name}`);
}
```
