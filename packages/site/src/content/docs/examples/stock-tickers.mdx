## About

This example has two machines:

1. a per stock-symbol **price machine**, and
2. a **ticker machine** composing zero or more **price machines**.

## Try it

import { StockTickers } from "../../../components";

<StockTickers client:only="react" />

## Price machine

Models the **realtime price** of a single stock. The machine's state name tells us if the price is `pending`, `live` or `stale`.

When the machine receives a `TICK` event it updates its state and starts a timer with a state `onEntry()` side-effect. If a new price is not received within the current price's `timeValid`ms, the machine sends itself a `STALE` event, and it transitions to `stale` (trading terminology: "stale" means the price is too old and cannot be used to place a trade).

## Ticker machine

Models a stock price ticker, with ticking prices for zero or more symbols.

The state name (`connecting`, `connected` and `connectionError`) tells us about the status of the connection to the fictional WebSocket price service.

A machine `onStart()` side-effect initiates the WebSocket client connection and setups up event listeners for lifecycle callbacks (`onopen`, `onerror` and `onmessage`). In fact all three of these WebSocket events trigger the machine to send itself an equivalent event. The side-effect returns a cleanup function to close the connection when the machine is stopped.

Client code can add/remove price-tickers by sending `ADD_TICKER` / `REMOVE_TICKER` events respectively. These events are handled in _any state_, and if the machine is currently `connected` they send "subscribe" or "unsubscribe" messages for the symbol to the remote service.

As symbols are added/removed, the _tickers machine_ creates/destroys _price machines_ and adds/removes them to/from its own state data.

Multiple clients can request symbols to be added/removed, and the machine uses reference-counting to share the _price machines_ and subscribe-to/unsubscribe-from the underlying WebSocket service just once per symbol.

Establishing a connection to a WebSocket service is an async operation so if the client added tickers before the connection is ready, the machine subscribes for all current symbols when it enters the `connected` state, _but only if the triggering event is `CONNECTED`_. (If we didn't check the event, when a new symbol was added, we would re-subscribe for all previous symbols again.)

When the machine receives data from the WebSocket service, it parses the string and extracts the prices for each symbol, and sends a `TICK` event to the relevant _price machines_.
