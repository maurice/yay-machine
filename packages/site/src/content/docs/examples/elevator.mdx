## About

This example models an elevator (aka lift). This model operates completely standalone, but can also be combined into a group of coordinated elevators with the [elevators controller](../elevators-controller/).

The elevator machine's state says where it is now and where it's going, plus it has a queue of floors to visit next (if any). When a `VISIT_FLOOR` event is received (either by summoning it at the wall, or a passenger pressing a button inside), the elevator either opens the doors (if already at the floor), else adds the floor to its queue.

State `onEntry()` side-effects use `setTimeout` to send events to the machine to simulate 5s to open/close doors. Similarly up/down travel progress is simulated by moving 1/10th of a floor every 500ms, meaning it takes 5s to go up/down one floor.

This machine's state data is homogenous and we're using `enableCopyDataOnTransition` to simplify some transitions that don't update the data.

## Usage

```typescript
const elevator = elevatorMachine.newInstance().start();

// passenger requests elevator at floor 5
elevator.send({ type: "VISIT_FLOOR", floor: 5 });

// time passes...

// ... doors open at floor 5
// passenger enters elevator and presses floor 12 button
elevator.send({ type: "VISIT_FLOOR", floor: 12 });
```
