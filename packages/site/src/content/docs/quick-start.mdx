title: Quick Start
description: yay-machine is a modern, simple, lightweight, zero-dependency, TypeScript state-machine library

## Installation

import { Code } from "@astrojs/starlight/components";

<Code
  lang="bash"
  code="npm add yay-machine"
  class="install-sh"
  mark={["yay-machine"]}
/>

## Example: ATM

Let's build an ATM state-machine!

To keep it simple, it will only offer a **cash withdrawal** service, and skip some unhappy paths.

**This interactive demo is powered by the state-machine _we're going to build_.**

### Build an outline

import { Aside } from "@astrojs/starlight/components";

<Aside type="note" title="How to start?">
Take a moment to think about the problem domain. In this case, reflect on your own experiences using ATMs...

What kinds of short- and long-lived **states** do they have. And what kinds of transient **events** can happen?

Finally what interactions would it need with the outside world?

</Aside>

Let's define all the **states**, **events** and **transitions** of the state-machine. Let's ignore _state-data_ and _event-payloads_ right now.

This will give us an **outline** and we can **fill in the details later**.

In practice it usually takes several iterations on states and events, then machine-definition, then states and events, then machine-definition and so on, before you find something that feels right. That's normal.

import { Tabs, TabItem } from "@astrojs/starlight/components";

### Try visualizing it

Drawing the state-chart on paper or a whiteboard might help to see what looks correct, and what is invalid or missing.

### External APIs

It looks OK so far, but it's becoming obvious we're going to need some external APIs such as

1. a **card reader** hardware device
2. a **cash dispenser** hardware device
3. a **keypad** hardware device
4. a **bank** service with which we can do cash withdrawal transactions

Let's sketch out those too:

import CardReader from "@yay-machine/example-machines/src/atm/CardReader.ts?raw";
import CashDispenser from "@yay-machine/example-machines/src/atm/CashDispenser.ts?raw";
import Keypad from "@yay-machine/example-machines/src/atm/Keypad.ts?raw";
import Bank from "@yay-machine/example-machines/src/atm/Bank.ts?raw";

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="CardReader.ts">
    <Code code={CardReader} lang="typescript" />
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="CashDispenser.ts">
    <Code code={CashDispenser} lang="typescript" />
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Keypad.ts">
    <Code code={Keypad} lang="typescript" />
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Bank.ts">
    <Code code={Bank} lang="typescript" />
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Putting it all together

Let's now add the _state-data_, _event-payloads_ and _side-effects_.

First we expand the states and events so they contain the data we need to capture.

```typescript ins={11-20} ins={37,41,45,49} ins={55-64} ins={66}
export interface AtmState {
  readonly name:
    | "waitingForCard"
    | "readingCard"
    | "serviceMenu"
    | "enterPin"
    | "enterAmount"
    | "validateWithdrawal"
    | "dispenseCash"
    | "ejectCard";
  readonly cardReader: CardReader;
  readonly cashDispenser: CashDispenser;
  readonly keypad: Keypad;
  readonly bank: Bank;
  readonly cardNumber: string;
  readonly pin: number;
  readonly withdrawalAmount: number;
  readonly transactionId: string;
  readonly withdrawalAttempts: number;
  readonly message: string;
}

export type AtmEvent =
  | {
      readonly type:
        | "CARD_INSERTED"
        | "CARD_INVALID"
        | "WITHDRAWAL_SELECTED"
        | "USER_CANCELLED"
        | "INCORRECT_PIN"
        | "INSUFFICIENT_FUNDS"
        | "CASH_DISPENSED"
        | "CARD_EJECTED";
    }
  | {
      readonly type: "CARD_READ";
      readonly cardNumber: string;
    }
  | {
      readonly type: "PIN_ENTERED";
      readonly pin: number;
    }
  | {
      readonly type: "AMOUNT_ENTERED";
      readonly withdrawalAmount: number;
    }
  | {
      readonly type: "WITHDRAWAL_APPROVED";
      readonly transactionId: string;
    };

export const atmMachine = defineMachine<AtmState, AtmEvent>({
  initialState: {
    name: "waitingForCard",
    cardReader: undefined!,
    cashDispenser: undefined!,
    keypad: undefined!,
    bank: undefined!,
    cardNumber: undefined!,
    pin: undefined!,
    withdrawalAmount: 0,
    transactionId: undefined!,
    withdrawalAttempts: 0,
    message: "",
  },
  enableCopyDataOnTransition: true,
  states: {
  // ...
```

We added `enableCopyDataOnTransition: true` so that TypeScript doesn't shout at us because all our transitions are missing [the `data()` callback](/reference/transitions/#generate-state-data-data).

We also set many of the default initial state-data properties to `undefined!` since we expect these to provided when the machine is instantiated.

Next we want to register an event listener with our card-reader device when the machine starts. When this event is received, we convert them to `AtmEvent`s and send them to the machine instance.

Notice how the `onStart()` callback returns a cleanup function to remove the event-listener when the machine is stopped.

```typescript ins={16-20}
export const atmMachine = defineMachine<AtmState, AtmEvent>({
  initialState: {
    name: "waitingForCard",
    cardReader: undefined!,
    cashDispenser: undefined!,
    keypad: undefined!,
    bank: undefined!,
    cardNumber: undefined!,
    pin: undefined!,
    withdrawalAmount: 0,
    transactionId: undefined!,
    withdrawalAttempts: 0,
    message: "",
  },
  enableCopyDataOnTransition: true,
  onStart: ({ state: { cardReader }, send }) => {
    return cardReader.addCardInsertedListener(() =>
      send({ type: "CARD_INSERTED" }),
    );
  },
  states: {
```

Now we can define real transitions, starting from the top.

First on entering `readingCard` card we use an `onEnter` side-effect function request the `cardReader` device to read the card. Depending on the result we either send the machine a `CARD_READ` event with the card-number, or a `CARD_INVALID` event. These are handled in the `readingCard` state and in both cases, we populate additional state-data (either the card-number or an error message), which is committed when the state changes to the next state.

```typescript "cardNumber" ins={8-13,17-20,24}
  states: {
    waitingForCard: {
      on: {
        CARD_INSERTED: { to: "readingCard" },
      },
    },
    readingCard: {
      onEnter: ({ state: { cardReader }, send }) => {
        cardReader.readCard().then(
          (cardNumber) => send({ type: "CARD_READ", cardNumber }),
          () => send({ type: "CARD_INVALID" }),
        );
      },
      on: {
        CARD_READ: {
          to: "serviceMenu",
          data: ({ state, event: { cardNumber } }) => ({
            ...state,
            cardNumber,
          }),
        },
        CARD_INVALID: {
          to: "ejectCard",
          data: ({ state }) => ({ ...state, message: "CARD UNREADABLE" }),
        },
      },
    },
```

Next we handle the `serviceMenu` and `enterPin` states.

In `serviceMenu` we use an `onEnter` side-effect to instruct the keypad to enable specific service-menu choices and wait for the user-selection or cancellation.

If the user selects the cash-withdrawal service, we transition to `enterPin` and set the `withdrawalAttempts` state-data to `1` because this is their first attempt.

In `enterPin` we use an `onEnter` side-effect function to request the user enters their PIN via the keypad. Once the pin is entered, the machine transitions to `enterAmount` with the pin saved to state-data for later.

```typescript "withdrawalAttempts: 1" "pin" ins={2-12,16,20,25-30,34,38}
    serviceMenu: {
      onEnter: ({ state: { keypad }, send }) => {
        keypad.readChoice(SERVICE_IDS).then(
          (serviceId) => {
            if (getService(serviceId) === "Withdraw Cash") {
              send({ type: "WITHDRAWAL_SELECTED" });
            }
            // handle other services here
          },
          () => send({ type: "USER_CANCELLED" }),
        );
      },
      on: {
        USER_CANCELLED: {
          to: "ejectCard",
          data: ({ state }) => ({ ...state, message: "" }),
        },
        WITHDRAWAL_SELECTED: {
          to: "enterPin",
          data: ({ state }) => ({ ...state, withdrawalAttempts: 1 }),
        },
      },
    },
    enterPin: {
      onEnter: ({ state: { keypad }, send }) => {
        keypad.readNumber(true).then(
          (pin) => send({ type: "PIN_ENTERED", pin }),
          () => send({ type: "USER_CANCELLED" }),
        );
      },
      on: {
        USER_CANCELLED: {
          to: "ejectCard",
          data: ({ state }) => ({ ...state, message: "" }),
        },
        PIN_ENTERED: {
          to: "enterAmount",
          data: ({ state, event: { pin } }) => ({ ...state, message: "", pin }),
        },
      },
    },
```

The `enterAmount` state is quite similar to `enterPin`. When the user has entered the amount, we have 3 potential transitions, the first two of which use `when()` to check for invalid amounts, in which case we populate the `message` state-data property, to show the user a friendly error.

If the amount is valid we proceed to `validateWithdrawal`.

```typescript "message" "withdrawalAmount" ins={2-8,17-22,26-30,34-38}
    enterAmount: {
      onEnter: ({ state: { keypad }, send }) => {
        keypad.readNumber(false).then(
          (withdrawalAmount) =>
            send({ type: "AMOUNT_ENTERED", withdrawalAmount }),
          () => send({ type: "USER_CANCELLED" }),
        );
      },
      on: {
        USER_CANCELLED: {
          to: "ejectCard",
          data: ({ state }) => ({ ...state, message: "" }),
        },
        AMOUNT_ENTERED: [
          {
            to: "enterAmount",
            when: ({ event: { withdrawalAmount } }) =>
              withdrawalAmount % 10 !== 0,
            data: ({ state }) => ({
              ...state,
              message: "AMOUNT MUST BE MULTIPLES OF 10",
            }),
          },
          {
            to: "enterAmount",
            when: ({ event: { withdrawalAmount } }) => withdrawalAmount > 250,
            data: ({ state }) => ({
              ...state,
              message: "CANNOT WITHDRAW MORE THAN 250",
            }),
          },
          {
            to: "validateWithdrawal",
            data: ({ state, event: { withdrawalAmount } }) => ({
              ...state,
              message: "",
              withdrawalAmount,
            }),
          },
        ],
      },
    },
```

The `validateWithdrawal` state is next and the `onEnter` side-effect contacts the bank to begin the cash-withdrawal transaction, sending the card-number and pin we captured earlier. If the bank approves, we send the machine a `WITHDRAWAL_APPROVED` with the `transactionId` which we store in state data when the event is handled during the transition to `dispenseCash`.

Also in the side-effect we're handling some unhappy paths when the promise rejects:

- if the bank tells us the pin was incorrect, we send an `INCORRECT_PIN` event to the machine, or
- else we send an `INSUFFICIENT_FUNDS` event to the machine

When handling the `INCORRECT_PIN` we have a conditional transition to `ejectCard` which is taken if the user has already tried unsuccessfully 3 times. Otherwise we'll go back to `enterPin`, incrementing `withdrawalAttempts`.

For the `INSUFFICIENT_FUNDS` event we just populate the `message` state-data property, as we've already done for earlier unhappy paths.

If the bank approves, we transition to `dispenseCash`.

```typescript "transactionId" "state.withdrawalAttempts" "message" ins={2-18,22-26,31-35,39-43,48-51}
    validateWithdrawal: {
      onEnter: ({
        state: { cardNumber, pin, withdrawalAmount, bank },
        send,
      }) => {
        bank.beginCashWithdrawal(cardNumber, pin, withdrawalAmount).then(
          (transactionId) => {
            send({ type: "WITHDRAWAL_APPROVED", transactionId });
          },
          (reason) => {
            if (reason === BankWithdrawalErrorReason.INSUFFICIENT_FUNDS) {
              send({ type: "INSUFFICIENT_FUNDS" });
            } else {
              send({ type: "INCORRECT_PIN" });
            }
          },
        );
      },
      on: {
        WITHDRAWAL_APPROVED: {
          to: "dispenseCash",
          data: ({ state, event: { transactionId } }) => ({
            ...state,
            transactionId,
            message: "CASH DISPENSING...",
          }),
        },
        INCORRECT_PIN: [
          {
            to: "ejectCard",
            when: ({ state }) => state.withdrawalAttempts === 3,
            data: ({ state }) => ({
              ...state,
              message: "TOO MANY FAILED ATTEMPTS\nPLEASE CONTACT BANK",
            }),
          },
          {
            to: "enterPin",
            data: ({ state }) => ({
              ...state,
              message: "INCORRECT PIN, TRY AGAIN?",
              withdrawalAttempts: state.withdrawalAttempts + 1,
            }),
          },
        ],
        INSUFFICIENT_FUNDS: {
          to: "ejectCard",
          data: ({ state }) => ({
            ...state,
            message: "INSUFFICIENT FUNDS",
          }),
        },
      },
    },
```

In `dispenseCash` we again use an `onEnter` side-effect to dispense the cash and inform the bank. We then immediately transition to `ejectCard`.

```typescript ins={2-7}
    dispenseCash: {
      onEnter: ({
        state: { withdrawalAmount, transactionId, cashDispenser, bank },
      }) => {
        bank.commitCashWithdrawn(transactionId);
        cashDispenser.dispenseCash(withdrawalAmount);
      },
      always: { to: "ejectCard" },
    },
```

Finally in `ejectCard` we use another `onEnter` side-effect to request the card-reader device to eject the card and when that completes, we return to `waitingForCard` and reset all the dynamic state-data for the next user-session.

```typescript ins={2-4,8-16}
    ejectCard: {
      onEnter: ({ state: { cardReader }, send }) => {
        cardReader.ejectCard().then(() => send({ type: "CARD_EJECTED" }));
      },
      on: {
        CARD_EJECTED: {
          to: "waitingForCard",
          data: ({ state }) => ({
            ...state,
            cardNumber: undefined!,
            pin: undefined!,
            withdrawalAmount: 0,
            transactionId: undefined!,
            withdrawalAttempts: 0,
            message: "",
          }),
        },
      },
    },
```

### Using the state-machine

Now we have our **definition** we will want to create and run a **machine instance**.

```typescript "atmMachine.newInstance({" "}).start()"
import { cardReader, cashDispenser, keypad, bank } from "./apis";

const atm = atmMachine
  .newInstance({
    initialState: {
      name: "waitingForCard",
      cardReader,
      cashDispenser,
      keypad,
      bank,
      cardNumber: undefined!,
      pin: undefined!,
      withdrawalAmount: 0,
      transactionId: undefined!,
      withdrawalAttempts: 0,
      message: "",
    },
  })
  .start();

const unsubscribe = atm.subscribe(({ state, event }) => {
  console.log("machine state", state, event);
});
```

We could also send it some events to test it

```typescript
atm.send({ type: "CARD_INSERTED" });
atm.send({ type: "CARD_READ", cardNumber: "555" });
```

If you want to see how the demo above is implemented, the [demo source code is here](https://github.com/maurice/yay-machine/tree/main/packages/site/src/components/ATM) and the [complete ATM state-machine is here](https://github.com/maurice/yay-machine/tree/main/packages/example-machines/src/atm/atmMachineComplete.ts).

### Reflections

As with all technology there are many ways to solve the same problem.

For instance we could have used [heterogenous state data](/reference/state/#heterogenous-state-data) since earlier states naturally have less state-data than later states.

We could have used global variables for the hardware-devices/bank-API and NOT added them to state-data. Having them in the state-data makes state-machines easier to unit test because such things can be mocked easily, but there's no right or wrong way.

This state-machine is very much controlling the other sub-systems; it is **reactive** but also **active**. This isn't always the case and you might write some state-machines that are only **reactive**.

### Finally

This turned out to be a fairly big example, so well done for making it this far 👏.

Take a minute to think about how you would build this ATM using other programming paradigms or libraries. Would it be [as concise (< 300 LoC)](https://github.com/maurice/yay-machine/tree/main/packages/example-machines/src/atm/atmMachineComplete.ts) and expressive as the state-machine definition? Would it have the same level of correctness?
